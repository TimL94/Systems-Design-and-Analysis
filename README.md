# Systems-Design-and-Analysis
Who was the client and what system did they want designed?

The DriverPass project involved designing a web based system for a company called DriverPass that provides driving test preparation and training services. The client wanted a system that would allow students to register, schedule and manage driving lessons, access online course content, and take practice tests. The system also needed to support staff, instructors, and administrators with role based access and activity tracking.

Strengths

What did you do particularly well?

One area I performed well in was translating the client interview into clear system requirements and UML models. I successfully identified system actors, defined use cases, and created diagrams that accurately represented the required workflows. I also paid close attention to role permissions and system interactions to ensure the design reflected real business operations.

Areas for Improvement

If you could revise one part of your work, what would it be?

If I were to revise one part of this project, I would expand the nonfunctional requirements to include more measurable criteria such as performance thresholds and security standards. This would strengthen the document by making the requirements easier to validate during implementation.

User Needs and Design

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into the design?

I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the DriverPass interview transcript and identifying both explicit requirements and implied operational needs. These were implemented through defined use cases, actors, and system relationships. Considering user needs is critical because a system must support real workflows and users to be successful.

Design Approach

How do you approach designing software in the future?

My approach to software design begins with understanding the problem domain before focusing on technical solutions. I rely on techniques such as stakeholder interviews, use case modeling, activity diagrams, and object modeling to break complex systems into manageable components. These strategies help ensure designs are clear, scalable, and aligned with user expectations.
